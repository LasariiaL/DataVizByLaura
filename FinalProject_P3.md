# The final data story

Since completing Part II, significant changes were made to enhance the data story. I diligently worked on compiling essential data, creating charts, and mapping flood-prone areas in the US alongside green roof locations in major cities like Chicago, NYC, and San Francisco. All images, graphics, and textual content underwent thorough editing. Comprehensive citations were added to validate the resources used. Notably, I expanded the project to include a Cost-Benefit analysis and a Call for Action section. Three valuable resources were incorporated, aiding both professionals and flood victims.

Notably, I expanded the project to include a Cost-Benefit analysis and a Call for Action section. Three valuable resources were incorporated, aiding both professionals and flood victims.

## The audience
Speaking of my audience, I identified distinct preferences and requirements through interviews conducted during Part II. Professionals, including architects, urban planners, and policy makers, expressed a need for in-depth resources related to regulations and implementation aspects. Victims of previous floods, on the other hand, sought guidance on preventive measures for future incidents. To address these needs, I showcased real-life examples from cities with successful green roof practices, elucidated the cost factors involved in implementing green roofs in 2023, and compiled essential resources for study and construction purposes.

## Final design decisions
In terms of design decisions, I carefully curated a blue-green palette to harmonize with the project's theme of flood mitigation through green roofs. Visual elements were crucial, and I utilized a mix of charts, pictures, and illustrations. Tools like Tableau Desktop, Tableau Public, and Flourish Studio were employed for creating dynamic charts, while Canva facilitated the design of compelling illustrations such as the Urban Flood cause and Green Roof benefits. Additionally, I integrated animations and gifs strategically to bring the narrative to life, ensuring a seamless flow from one section to another. 

# Final thoughts
Reflecting on the entire process, I found it to be immensely enjoyable. Learning a new platform, Shorthand, was particularly exciting as it enabled me to present my data story in an engaging manner. Challenges did arise, notably with issues in Tableau's HTML code, necessitating additional cleaning time. While I had initially planned to explore platforms like RAWGraphs and Figma, the current project did not require their implementation. The most daunting aspect proved to be sourcing and cleaning appropriate data, highlighting the critical importance of this step in the data storytelling process.
