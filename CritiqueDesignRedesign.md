The selected data visualization is "*Fig. 3: Socially inferred intersecting gender-ethnicity within each creative domain, where each light gray rectangle represents proportion within the domain,*" which presents a visual representation of the gender and ethnicity intersections within the four creative domains (art, fashion, film, and music).
The choice of this particular data visualization is related to several reasons:
- The data provides a clear overview of the gender and ethnicity distribution within each creative domain.
- It can help professionals in creative industries recognize the need for greater diversity and inclusion efforts and can also serve as an eye-opener for the general public by providing a clear and tangible representation of the demographic composition in these fields.
- The data visualization could benefit from some enhancements as it currently lacks clarity. Here are some suggested improvements:
1. The use of red for emphasis could be seen as a drawback, as it might convey negative connotations or evoke strong emotions. A more neutral color might have been a better choice to avoid distraction.
2. The small text in smaller areas makes it difficult to read, and this can be a usability issue. It would be beneficial to improve the legibility of text in smaller sections.
3. Not having numerical data directly on the chart could be a limitation. Viewers have to refer to Table 1 for specific data, which can be inconvenient and disrupt the flow of understanding.
4. The title should be simplified for clarity and conciseness.
5. While a Treemap is a good choice, exploring other types of charts might enhance its overall effectiveness.

#### To make this graph more appealing to the art industry audience, consider adding more creativity and using vibrant colors.
