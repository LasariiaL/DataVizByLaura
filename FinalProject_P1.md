# Enhancing the flood resilience of existing buildings through green infrastructure
The aim of this project is to explore and demonstrate how the integration of green infrastructure, specifically green roofs and green facades, can enhance the flood resilience of existing buildings in urban environments. With climate change leading to an increase in extreme weather events, including flooding, it's crucial to find sustainable solutions that not only mitigate flood risks but also contribute to urban sustainability and aesthetics. This project seeks to showcase the benefits of greenery in building design as a means to reduce flood vulnerability, improve urban ecosystems, and create more resilient cities.

## 1 Project Structure:
### Introduction
Background information: flood-prone cities in the U.S. with the use of Choropleth maps, the type of building most exposed to flooding, discuss the increasing frequency of urban flooding events, and the goal of enhancing flood resilience through green infrastructure.

### Green Infrastructure for Flood Mitigation
Why green roofs and vertical greenery (facades)? Discuss how green roofs and facades can mitigate flood risks. Existing examples. Design considerations and technical aspects.

### Benefits of Green Infrastructure
1. Flood mitigation: resilience
2. Environmental: eco-friendly
3. Financial: energy savings or cost of implementation

### Future Potential
All the best aspects of using green infrastructure for flood prevention and resilience. Recommendations on retrofitting existing buildings.

## 2 Data source
I am going to recreate the data based on various sources (https://data.world/ , https://www.kaggle.com/ , GIS , FEMA), can be extended if needed. The list of data sources will also include magazines and websites that were used for the textual part of the project, can also include images.

## 3 Method and medium
 I am considering using Esri's Story Maps due to my prior experience with the platform. However, I also plan to explore Shorthand to acquire new skills and will ultimately choose the platform that best suits the project's needs. Additionally, if necessary, I can incorporate PowerPoint slides as an additional component.
