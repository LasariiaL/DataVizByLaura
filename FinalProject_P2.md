### Urban Flooding is a Growing Concern
The need for resilient and sustainable cities is greater than ever in the face of rising climate change-related events and increased urbanization. Extreme weather events, especially urban flooding, is becoming more and more likely to affect cities, which pose significant threats to human populations, the environment and its biodiversity. Innovative, integrative strategies that go beyond conventional building techniques are needed to address these difficulties.

### Understanding the root causes helps in effective mitigation strategies
Changes in weather patterns, including **intense rainfall and prolonged periods of drought followed by heavy rain**, can exacerbate urban flooding. Unplanned and rapid urban growth can overwhelm existing drainage and sewage systems, causing flooding in newly developed areas. Urban flooding occurs predominantly in city centers and neighborhoods lacking sufficient green infrastructure, proper drainage systems, and permeable surfaces capable of absorbing water.

### Green Roofs: A Solution for All Climates
Intensive and extensive green roofs are effective solutions for mitigating urban flooding due to their ability to absorb and manage rainwater in urban environments. Both extensive and intensive green roofs act as sponges, soaking up rainwater. This reduces the volume of water that would otherwise flow directly into stormwater drains and overload urban drainage systems. Green roofs release absorbed rainwater gradually through evapotranspiration, where plants release water vapor. Moreover, intensive green roofs, with their deeper soil layers, can support a diverse range of plant species. This biodiversity enhances the ecosystem, promoting natural balance and resilience against extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall.
