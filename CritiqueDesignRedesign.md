# Addressing Diversity Disparities in Creative Industries: Art, Fashion, Film, and Music
## Data visualization for revision and redesign
The selected data visualization is "Fig. 3: Socially inferred intersecting gender-ethnicity within each creative domain," which presents a visual representation of the gender and ethnicity intersections within the four creative domains (art, fashion, film, and music).
The choice of this particular data visualization is well-suited to the study's objectives for several reasons. 
- It provides a clear and concise overview of the gender and ethnicity distribution within each creative domain.
- The use of proportional area charts makes it easy to distinguish the dominance of certain identity groups within each creative domain.
- The light gray rectangles clearly illustrate the proportions, enabling viewers to discern the disparities at a glance.
- The figure aligns with the study's key findings, such as the dominance of white men in the creative fields and the underrepresentation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and other marginalized groups.
- This data visualization can help professionals in creative industries recognize the need for greater diversity and inclusion efforts and can also serve as an eye-opener for the general public by providing a clear and tangible representation of the demographic composition in these fields.
