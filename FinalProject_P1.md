# Enhancing the flood resilience of existing buildings through green infrastructure
The aim of this project is to explore and demonstrate how the integration of green infrastructure, specifically green roofs and green facades, can enhance the flood resilience of existing buildings in urban environments. With climate change leading to an increase in extreme weather events, including flooding, it's crucial to find sustainable solutions that not only mitigate flood risks but also contribute to urban sustainability and aesthetics. This project seeks to showcase the benefits of greenery in building design as a means to reduce flood vulnerability, improve urban ecosystems, and create more resilient cities.

## Outline
### Introduction
Background information: flood-prone cities in the U.S. with the use of Choropleth maps, the type of building most exposed to flooding, discuss the increasing frequency of urban flooding events, and the goal of enhancing flood resilience through green infrastructure.

### Understanding Green Infrastructure
Why green roofs and vertical greenery (facades)? Discuss how green roofs and facades can mitigate flood risks. Existing examples. Design considerations and technical aspects.

### Benefits of Green Infrastructure
Flood mitigation: resilience Environmental: eco-friendly. Financial: energy savings or cost of implementation.

### Future Potential
All the best aspects of using green infrastructure for flood prevention and resilience Recommendations.
