# About me
Hello! I am an architect currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Building Performance and Diagnostics at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Kuban State University and possess three years of experience as an architectural designer, along with one year of experience as an urban planner. My interests also extend to graphic design and contemporary art. Presently, I serve as a research assistant at the Center of Building Performance and Diagnostics, actively participating in projects focusing on urban smart surfaces and indoor air quality in commercial buildings. In addition, I work as a gallery assistant at Miller ICA Gallery, allowing me to stay closely connected to contemporary art.

# What I hope to learn
First and foremost, I aim to learn how to effectively visualize data in a way that is comprehensible to any audience. I want to explore the psychological impact that color, shape, and style have on individuals from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, I am eager to acquire skills in creating my GitHub portfolio and learning any tool that is presented in this course, for example, Tableau. I am extremely enthusiastic about becoming more proficient in data visualization through this course. I believe that the skills I gain will contribute to the development and presentation of my future thesis, assist me in pursuing my dream job, and further my career prospects.

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](/GeneralGovernmentDebt.md) 
Bar charts and grids of line charts serve different purposes in data visualization. Bar charts are great for comparing categories or showing how a single variable is distributed. On the other hand, grids of line charts are handy when you want to examine trends or relationships between multiple variables over time or across categories.
For my third data visualization, I chose a Treemap to represent countries' debt-to-GDP ratios. A Treemap breaks a rectangle into smaller rectangles, with each representing a portion of the whole. This works well for comparing debt ratios across countries and regions. The Treemap is strategic because it offers an overview of the global debt-to-GDP situation and allows us to explore how individual countries contribute to the overall picture. It's a useful tool to uncover patterns and outliers within regions or specific countries, helping us understand the complex relationship between debt and economic performance worldwide.
