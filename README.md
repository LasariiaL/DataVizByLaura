# About me
Hello! I am an architect currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Building Performance and Diagnostics at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Kuban State University and possess three years of experience as an architectural designer, along with one year of experience as an urban planner. My interests also extend to graphic design and contemporary art. Presently, I serve as a research assistant at the Center of Building Performance and Diagnostics, actively participating in projects focusing on urban smart surfaces and indoor air quality in commercial buildings. In addition, I work as a gallery assistant at Miller ICA Gallery, allowing me to stay closely connected to contemporary art.

# What I hope to learn
First and foremost, I aim to learn how to effectively visualize data in a way that is comprehensible to any audience. I want to explore the psychological impact that color, shape, and style have on individuals from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, I am eager to acquire skills in creating my GitHub portfolio and learning any tool that is presented in this course, for example, Tableau. I am extremely enthusiastic about becoming more proficient in data visualization through this course. I believe that the skills I gain will contribute to the development and presentation of my future thesis, assist me in pursuing my dream job, and further my career prospects.
