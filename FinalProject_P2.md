### Urban Flooding is a Growing Concern
The need for resilient and sustainable cities is greater than ever in the face of rising climate change-related events and increased urbanization. Extreme weather events, especially urban flooding, is becoming more and more likely to affect cities, which pose significant threats to human populations, the environment and its biodiversity. Innovative, integrative strategies that go beyond conventional building techniques are needed to address these difficulties.

### Understanding the root causes helps in effective mitigation strategies
Changes in weather patterns, including **intense rainfall and prolonged periods of drought followed by heavy rain**, can exacerbate urban flooding. Unplanned and rapid urban growth can overwhelm existing drainage and sewage systems, causing flooding in newly developed areas. Urban flooding occurs predominantly in city centers and neighborhoods lacking sufficient green infrastructure, proper drainage systems, and permeable surfaces capable of absorbing water.

### Green Roofs: A Solution for All Climates
Intensive and extensive green roofs are effective solutions for mitigating urban flooding due to their ability to absorb and manage rainwater in urban environments. Both extensive and intensive green roofs act as sponges, soaking up rainwater. This reduces the volume of water that would otherwise flow directly into stormwater drains and overload urban drainage systems. Green roofs release absorbed rainwater gradually through evapotranspiration, where plants release water vapor. Moreover, intensive green roofs, with their deeper soil layers, can support a diverse range of plant species. This biodiversity enhances the ecosystem, promoting natural balance and resilience against extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall.

### Green Roof Solutions for Growing Cities
Certainly, cities like New York and Chicago, known for their rapid urban growth and development, face significant challenges related to urban flooding. The expansion of concrete surfaces, coupled with intense rainfall and aging infrastructure, contributes to the increasing incidents of flooding. Implementing solutions such as extensive and intensive green roofs in these concrete jungles could offer several benefits:
- Stormwater Management
- Alleviating Drainage Systems
- Urban Cooling
- Biodiversity and Ecological Balance
- Community Well-being
- Sustainable Development
According to the Risk Factor website data, there are 83,841 properties in Chicago that have greater than a 26% chance of being severely affected by flooding over the next 30 years. This represents 42% of all properties in Chicago.

There are 156,304 properties in New York that have greater than a 26% chance of being severely affected by flooding over the next 30 years. This represents 30% of all properties in New York.
